 * touch: A basic implementation of the 'touch' utility.
 *
 * This program creates a new, empty file if it doesn't exist.
 * If the file already exists, it simply opens and closes it, which
 * may update the access time on some systems.
 *
 * Usage:
 * ./touch <filename>
 *
 * The program expects exactly one command-line argument: the name of the file.
